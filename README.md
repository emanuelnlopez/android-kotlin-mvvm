# android-kotlin-mvvm

Small Android quotes application written in Kotlin coded along with this tutorials:

- [Introduction to MVVM on Android - Tutorial - Learn Android Architecture Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T4zjIEkGOM)
- [Android MVVM Kotlin Tutorial - LiveData + ViewModel (Android Architecture Components)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7UxPYxgBoA)

The intent was to practice some `Kotlin` and to get to know the Model – View – ViewModel architectural pattern and how Android supports it with his first-party libraries.
